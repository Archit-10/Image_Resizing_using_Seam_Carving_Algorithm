# Seam-Carving

Introduction

Seam carving is a content-aware image resizing technique that reduces the size of an image by removing seams of pixels with the lowest energy. This technique helps preserve the most important features of the image while resizing.
Features

    Energy Calculation: Computes the energy of each pixel in the image.
    Seam Identification: Identifies the seam (path of pixels) with the lowest energy.
    Seam Removal: Removes the identified seam from the image.
    Resizing: Continuously removes seams until the image reaches the desired dimensions.

Requirements

    OpenCV: Used to extract and generate images.
    Python or C++: For implementing the seam carving algorithm.
    No C++ STL: The implementation must avoid using the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
